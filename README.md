# Slider-Animation
A slider animation with a great interface, created using CSS animations, adds visual appeal to the project. Enhancing the slider's functionality with JavaScript provides interactivity and creates an engaging user experience. This combination of appealing design and dynamic behaviour gives the project excellent exposure and impact.
